The Starfish, or Sea Star is not actually a fish! They are related to sand dollars and sea urchins <BR><BR>
	  A Sea Star can grow back a limb that has been cut off or fallen off as part of a defense mechanism <BR><BR>
	  AND the fallen limb of a Sea Star has the ability to grow an entirely new Sea Star! This is how they reproduce asexually <BR><BR>
	  There are about 2,000 different Sea Star species! <BR><BR>
	  Sea Stars eat with their stomachs inside out. They are able to push their stomachs through their mouth and just digest the animal before moving its stomach back into it's own body... </p>

  <p align="center"> The Crown-of-Thorns sea star is a deadly killer to the Great Barrier Reef. 
	  The Great Barrier Reef was already having severe issues with tropical cyclones and coral bleaching from temperatures rising, 
	  but there has also been a new algae bloom from nutrient rich water allowing for new sea star larvae growth. 
	  The Crown-of-Thorns Sea Star have since then been eating the coral faster than it can grow and reproduce, 
	  allowing for over 50% of the Great Barrier to have lost coral coverage since 1985, and around half of that is due solely to the Sea Star population<BR>
