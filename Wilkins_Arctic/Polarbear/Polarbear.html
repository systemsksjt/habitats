<p> The caribou has a short, stocky body that conserves heat, but its legs are long to help it move through the deep snow. Its winter coat provides insulation from the cold, and its muzzle and tail are short and covered in hair. The caribou's hooves are large and hollowed out. These make a handy tool for scooping up lichen, an important food source, thatâ€™s under snow. Although caribou can withstand the cold temperatures and harsh terrain of the Arctic tundra, they have a tough time coping with insects in the summer. They have been known to run for kilometres just to escape the hordes of pesky bugs! The caribou is the only member of the deer family where both males and females grow antlers. The antlers of the female are smaller than those of the male, but they are carried for a longer period of time. Male caribou shed their antlers in November or December, after mating. Females will often carry theirs until June, after they have given birth, to help them defend food sources while nursing their calves.
