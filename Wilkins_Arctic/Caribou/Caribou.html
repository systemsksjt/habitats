<p> The Arctic region is found in the northernmost part of Earth. As well as the Arctic Ocean, the Arctic region is made up of parts of Russia, Greenland, Canada, USA, Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland. Indigenous people who live in the Arctic have adapted to the cold weather and harsh environmental conditions. The name ‘Arctic’ comes from a Greek word meaning ‘near the bear’. The coldest recorded temperature in the Arctic is around −68 °C (−90 °F). Over recent years, the Arctic region has shrunk due to global warming. Small shrubs can grow in warmer parts of the Arctic, as well as various herbs, mosses and lichens. A number of different types of animals make their home in the arctic, including polar bears, wolverines, squirrels, birds, walrus and seals. The Arctic region is home to the North Pole. The Arctic has a number of natural resources, including fish, oil, gas and various minerals.
