<p> Penguins are flightless birds. While other birds have wings for flying, penguins have adapted flippers to help them swim in the water. Most penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere. The Galapagos Penguin is the only penguin species that ventures north of the equator in the wild. Penguins eat a range of fish and other sealife that they catch underwater. Penguins spend around half their time in water and the other half on land. The Emperor Penguin is the tallest of all penguin species, reaching as tall as 120 cm (47 in) in height. Emperor Penguins often huddle together to keep warm in the cold temperatures of Antarctica.  King Penguins are the second largest penguin species. They have four layers of feathers to help keep them warm on the cold subantarctic islands where they breed. Chinstrap Penguins get their name from the thin black band under their head. At times it looks like they’re wearing a black helmet, which might be useful as they’re considered the most aggressive type of penguin. Crested penguins have yellow crests, as well as red bills and eyes.Crested Penguin Yellow eyed penguins (or Hoiho) are endangered penguins native to New Zealand. Their population is believed to be around 4000. Little Blue Penguins are the smallest type of penguin, averaging around 33 cm (13 in) in height.
